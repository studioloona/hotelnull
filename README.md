Hotel Null is a passion project developed for an AR/VR university course in under three months. It’s a VR observation game where a hotel corridor keeps gaslighting you. Walk , spot changes, and trust your eyes before reality resets.

Control with usual VR controlls.
Testing was done only on Meta Quest 2. Any errors on other devices are not accounted for.
